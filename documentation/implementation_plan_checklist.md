# Derelict Dawn Implementation Checklist

This checklist tracks our progress through the implementation plan for the Derelict Dawn game.

## Phase 1: Environment Setup

- [✅] **Clone Starter Kit**: Clone the CodeGuide Starter Pro repo from `https://github.com/codeGuide-dev/codeguide-starter-pro` into your working directory.
- [✅] **Create Branches**: Initialize a Git repository and create `develop` and `main` branches.
- [✅] **Install Node.js**: Confirm Node.js is installed (v20.2.0 is being used).
- [✅] **Install Next.js 14**: Project is using Next.js 14 as the front-end framework.
- [✅] **Install Additional Frontend Dependencies**: Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Radix UI, and Lucide Icons are installed.
- [✅] **Install Supabase Client**: Supabase JS client for authentication and progress tracking is installed.

## Phase 2: Frontend Development

- [✅] **Setup App Structure**: App folder structure with `/app`, `/components`, `/hooks`, `/lib`, `/types`, and `/utils` directories.
- [✅] **Implement Global Layout**: Updated `/app/layout.tsx` to include global layout with dark theme.
- [✅] **Configure Tailwind CSS**: Updated `/app/globals.css` with dark, sci-fi theme.
- [✅] **Create Navigation Component**: Created `/components/ui/navbar.tsx` with links to all game pages.
- [✅] **UI Improvements**: Enhanced the navigation sidebar by removing the settings cog and improving the System Status display.
- [✅] **Develop Reactor Page**: Created `/app/reactor/page.tsx` with energy generation functionality.
- [✅] **Develop Processor Page**: Created `/app/processor/page.tsx` with tech tree system, Insight resource, and upgrade paths.
- [✅] **Develop Crew Quarters Page**: Created `/app/crew-quarters/page.tsx` for crew generation with awakening system and upgrades.
- [✅] **Develop Manufacturing Page**: Created `/app/manufacturing/page.tsx` for scrap collection, cargo capacity, and manufacturing automation.
- [✅] **Develop Logs Page**: Created `/app/logs/page.tsx` for narrative progression with unlockable story entries.
- [✅] **Implement Offline Simulation Visuals**: Added offline progress component to show resources gained while away.
- [✅] **Validation**: Tested navigation and page rendering with npm run dev.

## Phase 3: Backend Development

- [ ] **Setup Supabase Connection**: Configure Supabase client in `/utils/supabase/server.ts`.
- [ ] **Implement Persistent Saving Logic**: Develop functions to save and load game state.
- [ ] **Develop API Endpoint for Progress Updates**: Create `/app/api/progress/route.ts`.
- [ ] **Integrate Authentication**: Set up Supabase authentication system.
- [ ] **Implement Error Handling and Data Integrity Checks**: Add try-catch blocks and validation.

## Phase 4: Integration

- [ ] **Connect Frontend to Progress API**: Add functions to send state to API.
- [ ] **Integrate Offline Progress Calculation**: Update client-side logic for offline gains.
- [ ] **Error Handling UI**: Add components for displaying error messages.
- [ ] **Test Complete User Flow**: Test navigation, resource generation, and data persistence.

## Phase 5: Deployment

- [ ] **Set Environment Variables**: Create `.env.local` file with Supabase credentials.
- [ ] **Configure Vercel for Deployment**: Link GitHub repository to Vercel.
- [ ] **Deploy the Application**: Initiate deployment from Vercel.
- [ ] **Post-Deployment Testing**: Test the entire user flow on production.

## Current Status

We have completed all of Phase 1 and all 12 steps of Phase 2. The application is now running locally with:
- A sci-fi themed dark mode UI
- Navigation between pages
- A functional Reactor page with energy generation and upgrades
- A functional Processor page with Insight generation and tech tree placeholders
- A functional Crew Quarters page with crew awakening, capacity upgrades, and worker crews
- A functional Manufacturing page with scrap collection, cargo hold upgrades, and manufacturing bays
- A functional Logs page with narrative story entries that unlock as the game progresses
- Offline progress simulation to show resources gained while away

Next steps:
