# Derelict Dawn Guide - Systems Documentation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for comprehensively documenting each system within the Derelict Dawn Guide codebase. A systematic approach to documentation will ensure consistency, completeness, and maintainability as the project evolves.

## Documentation Structure

Each system's documentation should follow this structure:

1. **System Overview**
   - Purpose and responsibilities
   - Key features
   - Relationship to other systems

2. **Architecture**
   - Core classes and interfaces
   - Data flow diagram
   - State management approach

3. **Key Components**
   - Detailed explanation of major components
   - Class/interface documentation
   - Important methods and their purposes

4. **Integration Points**
   - How the system interacts with other systems
   - Event subscriptions and emissions
   - API surface

5. **UI Components** (if applicable)
   - Overview of related UI components
   - State management in UI
   - User interaction patterns

6. **Configuration**
   - Available configuration options
   - Default values
   - Customization points

7. **Examples**
   - Usage examples
   - Common patterns
   - Code snippets

8. **Future Considerations**
   - Known limitations
   - Planned improvements
   - Potential refactorings

## Systems to Document

Based on the codebase structure, we should document the following systems:

### Core Systems
1. **Game Engine** (`app/game/core/GameEngine.ts`)
   - Central orchestrator
   - Game loop
   - State management

2. **Event Bus** (`app/game/core/EventBus.ts`)
   - Event subscription
   - Event emission
   - Performance considerations

3. **Memory Cache** (`app/game/core/MemoryCache.ts`)
   - State persistence
   - Cache management
   - Integration with React

### Game Systems
4. **Resource System** (`app/game/systems/ResourceSystem.ts`)
   - Resource production
   - Resource consumption
   - Resource limits

5. **Upgrade System** (`app/game/systems/UpgradeSystem.ts`)
   - Upgrade definitions
   - Purchase mechanics
   - Effects on game stats

6. **Action System** (`app/game/systems/ActionSystem.ts`)
   - Action processing
   - Integration with other systems
   - Player interaction

7. **Encounter System** (`app/game/systems/EncounterSystem.ts`)
   - Encounter generation
   - Region-specific content
   - Encounter resolution

8. **Combat System** (`app/game/systems/CombatSystem.ts`)
   - Combat mechanics
   - Enemy AI
   - Combat resolution

9. **Log System** (`app/game/systems/LogSystem.ts`)
   - Story progression
   - Log unlocking conditions
   - Player notifications

### React Integration
10. **Game Provider** (`app/game/hooks/useGame.tsx`)
    - React context setup
    - State management
    - Action dispatching

11. **UI Components**
    - Category-specific components
    - Encounter components
    - Combat components

## Documentation Format

Each system's documentation should be created as a separate Markdown file in the `documentation/systems/` directory. The filename should follow the pattern `system_name.md` (e.g., `event_bus.md`, `combat_system.md`).

## Documentation Priority

Systems should be documented in this priority order:

1. Core Systems (Game Engine, Event Bus, Memory Cache)
2. Primary Game Systems (Resource, Upgrade, Action)
3. Complex Game Systems (Encounter, Combat)
4. React Integration
5. UI Components

## Template

Here's a template to use for each system documentation file:

```markdown
# [System Name]

## Overview

[Brief description of the system's purpose and role in the game]

## Architecture

[Architectural description, including diagrams if possible]

### Core Classes and Interfaces

```typescript
// Key interfaces and types
export interface ExampleInterface {
    // ...
}
```

### Data Flow

[Description of how data flows through this system]

## Key Components

### [Component 1]

[Description of component 1]

```typescript
// Example code for component 1
```

### [Component 2]

[Description of component 2]

```typescript
// Example code for component 2
```

## Integration Points

### Events Emitted

| Event Name | Data | Purpose |
|------------|------|---------|
| `example_event` | `{ type: string }` | Triggered when... |

### Events Consumed

| Event Name | Handler | Purpose |
|------------|---------|---------|
| `other_event` | `handleOtherEvent` | Responds to... |

## UI Components (if applicable)

[List and describe related UI components]

## Configuration

[Document configuration options]

## Examples

### [Example 1]

```typescript
// Example usage code
```

## Future Considerations

[Notes about future improvements or refactorings]
```

## Implementation Timeline

- **Week 1**: Document Core Systems
- **Week 2**: Document Primary Game Systems
- **Week 3**: Document Complex Game Systems
- **Week 4**: Document React Integration and UI Components

## Next Steps

1. Create the directory structure for system documentation
2. Start with documenting the Event Bus system as it's a foundational component
3. Move on to the Game Engine documentation
4. Proceed through the remaining systems in priority order

## Conclusion

Following this documentation plan will result in comprehensive, consistent documentation across all systems in the Derelict Dawn Guide. This documentation will be invaluable for onboarding new developers, maintaining the codebase, and planning future extensions.
