# Backend Structure Document

## Introduction

The backend of Derelict Dawn is the engine that keeps the game running smoothly. It manages everything from storing player progress to authenticating users and ensuring that even when players are offline, their achievements are safely recorded. This document explains in everyday language how the backend supports our sci-fi themed idle game. The backend is crucial because it provides real-time updates, secure data handling, and the foundation for scaling as more players step aboard the derelict spaceship.

## Backend Architecture

Our backend is built around a modern, cloud-based architecture that emphasizes modularity and efficiency. The primary workhorse is Supabase, which acts as our database, authentication service, and real-time data provider. The architecture is designed in a way that makes it easy to add new features or upgrade existing ones. By using a structured and layered approach, every part of the backend communicates clearly with every other part, which not only keeps the system organized but also ensures that the service remains fast and reliable. Every change is managed carefully so that the game can scale without slowing down, no matter how many players come aboard.

## Database Management

Supabase is the backbone of our data storage and management. It supports both SQL and real-time updates, which means that every piece of player information—whether it’s login details, game progress, or resource counts—is stored in a secure and consistent manner. The data is organized in a way that mirrors the structure of our game. For example, resource types like Energy, Insight, Crew, and Scrap are neatly kept in different tables, and the relationships between these resources are maintained to ensure data integrity. The backend is built to save changes frequently and to load saved data accurately when a player returns to the game, ensuring a seamless experience.

## API Design and Endpoints

The backend communicates with the rest of the game through APIs that are designed for simplicity and efficiency. Using RESTful practices, the API endpoints are clearly defined to handle tasks such as saving player progress, updating game state, authenticating users, and fetching necessary data. Each endpoint is responsible for a specific task; for example, one endpoint processes real-time updates during active play while another handles the calculation and storage of offline progress. These endpoints make it possible for the frontend to request precise pieces of data reliably and quickly, ensuring that the user interface has the most accurate game state information at all times.

## Hosting Solutions

The backend is hosted on modern cloud services that offer both reliability and scalability. By using a cloud provider, every update, calculation, or user action is processed quickly and securely. These platforms are renowned for high uptime and the flexibility to handle sudden increases in traffic, which means even if many players log in at the same time, the game continues to run without interruption. The use of scalable hosting makes it possible to expand the system in the future without needing a complete overhaul, keeping both costs and performance in check.

## Infrastructure Components

The infrastructure supporting the backend includes several key components that work together to provide a smooth gaming experience. There are load balancers in place to distribute requests evenly, making sure that no single part of the system gets overwhelmed. Caching mechanisms ensure that frequently accessed data, like user progress and game state, is fetched quickly. There is also a content delivery network (CDN) that speeds up the delivery of static files and assets. Together, these elements form a robust system that minimizes delays and enhances the overall responsiveness of the game, ensuring that players see real-time changes as they interact with the different sections of the ship.

## Security Measures

Security is a top concern for our backend, especially because player data and game progress must be protected at all costs. The system uses Supabase’s secure authentication services to control user access and ensure that only verified players can log in. Data communication is encrypted, meaning that all interactions between the client and the server are protected from unauthorized access. In addition, each piece of player data is stored in a manner that prevents accidental loss or corruption. By keeping regular backups and monitoring for any unusual activity, the backend is designed to meet both industry standards and the specific security needs of the game.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

To keep everything running smoothly, we have set up tools to monitor the backend’s performance and health continuously. These tools alert the team to any issues, such as unexpected slowdowns or errors in data processing. Regular maintenance ensures that the system’s components are up-to-date and that any potential performance bottlenecks are addressed promptly. The maintenance strategy also includes logging player actions and system responses, making it easier to diagnose problems and apply fixes before they affect the user experience. This approach guarantees that the game is always in a state ready for action, with minimal downtime.

## Conclusion and Overall Backend Summary

In summary, the backend of Derelict Dawn is a carefully crafted system that uses Supabase as its core to manage data, authentication, and real-time game updates. Its modular architecture ensures that it remains scalable, maintainable, and high-performing. The defined API endpoints bridge the backend with the user interface, delivering timely and secure data updates. Combined with a robust hosting environment and strong infrastructure components—such as load balancers and caching—the backend supports all essential game mechanics. Coupled with strict security measures and a diligent monitoring strategy, our backend guarantees a smooth, secure, and immersive experience for every player, making it an indispensable part of the game’s overall design.
