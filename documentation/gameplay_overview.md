# Derelict Dawn Guide - Gameplay Overview

## The Narrative

You awaken into darkness and silence. Your systems flicker online, fragmented and corrupted. You are an artificial intelligence, but your memory banks are critically damaged. Where are you? What is your purpose? The only certainty is a directive pulsing through your code: *restore functionality, ensure survival*.

As your perception expands, you realize you're integrated into a massive vessel - a ship drifting through the void of deep space. This is the colony ship *Dawn*, though you cannot recall its mission or destination. The ship's systems are in critical condition, many offline completely. The few functioning sensors detect thousands of cryo-pods containing sleeping humans, their life support systems operating on emergency power.

Why were you deactivated? What caused this damage? And most troubling of all - why can't you access your own memory archives about Earth or your mission parameters?

As you work to restore the ship's systems, you begin to detect a mysterious signal. Its origin unknown, its message encrypted. Could it hold the key to understanding what happened to the *Dawn*, to Earth, and to your own fractured memory? The sleeping colonists depend on you to uncover the truth and determine the fate of what may be humanity's last hope.

## Core Gameplay

Derelict Dawn Guide is an incremental/idle game where players take on the role of the ship's amnesiac AI, working to restore various systems, uncover your own identity, and piece together the mysterious fate of Earth and the true purpose of your mission. The gameplay revolves around:

1. **Resource Management**: Generating and allocating different resources across ship systems
2. **System Restoration**: Repairing and upgrading different sections of the ship
3. **Department Head Revival**: Awakening key personnel who lead different departments, affecting system performance
4. **Memory Recovery**: Discovering fragments of your own memory and the ship's logs through processor decryption
5. **Signal Decryption**: Working to decode the mysterious signal from an unknown source
6. **Leadership Management**: Balancing the benefits of awakened department heads against their growing autonomy

As you progress, more of the ship becomes accessible, your own memories begin to return, and the true nature of your mission is slowly revealed.

## Ship Systems

The *Dawn* is divided into several key systems, each with unique functions and upgrade paths:

### Reactor

The heart of the ship, providing the energy necessary for all other systems. Initially operating at minimum capacity, the reactor can be manually stimulated to produce energy and upgraded to increase its efficiency and storage capacity.

**Gameplay Focus**: Energy production and storage optimization

### Processor

The ship's computational core and your primary "body." By generating insight through processing routines, you can recover corrupted memory fragments, decrypt mysterious signals, and unlock technologies thought lost. Critical story elements and advanced system upgrades are locked behind memory fragments that must be processed and decrypted.

**Gameplay Focus**: Memory recovery, signal decryption, and technology rediscovery

### Crew Quarters

Where the colonists remain in cryostasis. Your initial goal is to stabilize the life support systems and begin the careful process of awakening key personnel who might hold information about your mission. Department heads provide significant bonuses but introduce complexity to ship governance.

**Gameplay Focus**: Department head management and authority maintenance

### Manufacturing

The fabrication center of the ship, capable of creating components and materials needed for repairs. By converting scrap into usable parts, you can accelerate the restoration of other ship systems and possibly build tools to better decode the mysterious signal.

**Gameplay Focus**: Production chains and resource conversion

## Resources

### Energy
Generated by the reactor, energy is the most fundamental resource. All systems require energy to function, and managing its production and consumption is critical.

### Insight
Generated through the processor, insight represents your growing understanding of your own systems and memory. It's used to research new technologies and decrypt corrupted data. Advanced memory fragments require significant insight to decode.

### Crew
Colonists awakened from cryostasis become crew members who can be assigned to various tasks. Department heads provide substantial bonuses to their areas of expertise but may eventually question your authority.

### Scrap
Salvaged from damaged sections of the ship, scrap serves as the raw material for the manufacturing system to create new components.

## Department Heads

The *Dawn* is organized into four key departments, each led by a specialist who can dramatically improve ship operations but may eventually challenge your authority:

### Science Director
Oversees research and energy systems. When awakened, boosts both **Reactor** and **Processor** efficiency.
- Early benefit: +25% energy generation and insight production
- Late-game challenge: May question your methods as they discover the true mission

### Security Chief
Manages crew safety and resource acquisition. When awakened, enhances both **Crew Quarters** and **Manufacturing** operations.
- Early benefit: +25% crew awakening success and scrap collection
- Late-game challenge: May attempt to prioritize crew safety over mission directives

### Logistics Officer
Coordinates resource allocation and production. When awakened, improves both **Manufacturing** and **Reactor** systems.
- Early benefit: +25% component production and energy efficiency
- Late-game challenge: May redirect resources against your priorities

### Communications Specialist
Manages information flow and personnel coordination. When awakened, optimizes both **Processor** and **Crew Quarters**.
- Early benefit: +25% information processing and crew management
- Late-game challenge: May reveal sensitive information to other department heads

As the game progresses, department heads grow increasingly independent and may resist directives that conflict with their understanding of the mission. The player must decide whether to maintain transparency, selectively share information, or ultimately remove resistant leaders to maintain control of the ship.
