# Derelict Dawn App Flow Document

## Introduction

This document explains every step and page of Derelict Dawn, a sci-fi themed idle game where players manage an AI to revive a derelict spaceship. The game is crafted for teenagers and young adults and builds an immersive narrative around restoring the ship. From generating basic resources in the Reactor to unlocking new systems like the Processor, Crew Quarters, Manufacturing, and finally experiencing the mysterious narrative within the Logs, every action has been carefully designed to maintain an engaging user experience. The game is built with modern technologies including Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase to ensure smooth performance, state persistence, and data integrity even during offline play.

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a new user discovers Derelict Dawn, they are welcomed by a dark and mysterious landing page that sets the tone for the derelict spaceship waiting to be revived. The onboarding process begins with a clear sign-up or sign-in option, powered by Supabase and Clerk Auth. Users can create an account using email credentials or social login methods if available. Once the user enters their information, the app verifies and logs them in while securely setting up their persistent game data. In the event a user forgets their password, a recovery option is provided that sends them instructions via email. Signing out is simple and easy to find in the navigation, ensuring that user sessions are managed securely and effectively.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After signing in, players are directed to a main dashboard that serves as the central hub of the game. This page is visually designed with a dark, evolving sci-fi aesthetic that mirrors the state of the derelict ship. The dashboard features visible elements such as headers, a navigation menu, and dynamic progress indicators that update in real time. Here, players see a summary of their resources and system upgrades, with hints of new sections that will unlock as they progress. This home page acts as the anchor point, offering intuitive links to the Reactor, Processor, Crew Quarters, Manufacturing, and Logs pages as players advance in their journey of ship reactivation.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

The game journey begins at the Reactor page where players manually click interactions to generate Energy. As energy accumulates, users see animated progress bars and visual cues that indicate upgrades in capacity and the eventual activation of automation through Fuel Injectors. Once a specific energy threshold is reached, the game automatically unlocks the Processor page. Here, players dive into a tech tree system focused on accumulating Insight, which represents research and technological upgrades. As resource thresholds continue to be met, the Crew Quarters page unlocks. This section marks the revival of crew members and adds a human element to the process, with the awakening of crew hinted as a vital turning point in the narrative. Following this, the Manufacturing page becomes accessible. In Manufacturing, players gather Scrap, the raw material used for crafting enhancements. Visual feedback, such as updated progress bars, informs players of their current Scrap resources and the effectiveness of their automated Manufacturing Bays. Separately, logs written in a mysterious yet immersive style unravel the story behind the ship and its AI. These static narrative entries begin with hints of forgotten purposes and evolve into rich storytelling as major game events, ship attacks, and navigational breakthroughs occur. Page navigation is smooth and intuitive, with clear transitions from one resource management section to the next, ensuring users feel connected throughout their journey. Offline play is also supported by continuously updating the game state and simulating resource gains whenever players return after a break. The interface revisits the concluding elements of upgrades and animated progress that keep the player engaged even in their absence.

## Settings and Account Management

Throughout the game, players have access to settings where they can manage personal details, update display preferences, and configure notifications regarding game progress. Within this section, users can also view their progress history and make adjustments to their subscription or billing details if new features are enabled in future releases. The settings page is designed to be clear and easy to navigate, returning players quickly to their main dashboard. Options for updating user information, such as email or password, are readily available, ensuring that account management does not interrupt the overall game experience.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

Derelict Dawn is built to handle errors gracefully. Should a user input incorrect information during sign-up or encounter connectivity issues during gameplay, an error message is displayed clearly on the screen with guidance on how to resolve the issue. For invalid data entries, like a malformed e-mail address or failure to meet form requirements, the error messages provide useful instructions to correct the mistake. If connectivity is lost, players see a fallback screen that informs them the game is attempting to reconnect, ensuring that progress is not lost thanks to continuous auto-save functions integrated through Supabase. In addition, when players attempt restricted actions or access pages that aren’t unlocked yet, the interface offers a gentle prompt explaining the requirement of resource thresholds to proceed further. This ensures that the user regains normal flow without confusion or frustration.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

The journey in Derelict Dawn starts with a mysterious landing page and smooth onboarding that securely handles user sign-up and login. From there, players connect with the main dashboard that acts as the central hub of their space revival mission. Starting at the Reactor, the gameplay is divided into focused sections—each offering its own unique resources, upgrades, and subtle narrative breakthroughs. As users progress, they unlock the Processor, Crew Quarters, and Manufacturing pages, all while discovering story elements in the Logs. Offline progress simulation and regular data saving ensure a seamless experience regardless of user presence. Ultimately, Derelict Dawn takes players on an evolving journey of resource mastery, technological discovery, and narrative revelation, encapsulating the mission to awaken not only a derelict spaceship but also the mysterious past of an ancient AI. Every component is built to work harmoniously, ensuring that each action, page, and error state is connected in a clear and engaging user journey.
