# Derelict Dawn – Roadmap & Work Log

This file is the **single source of truth** for ongoing engineering tasks, ideas, and technical debt for the Derelict Dawn project.  
Update it in every PR/commit that completes, changes, or adds work so that the roadmap always reflects reality.

## How to use this document
1. **Adding work** – append a new unchecked task under the correct section. Keep descriptions short but clear.  
2. **Completing work** – mark the checkbox with an `x` (e.g. `[x]`) and, if helpful, add a brief bullet of what changed or link to the commit/PR.  
3. **Re-prioritising** – feel free to move tasks around within their section to reflect current priority.  
4. **Do not create extra roadmap docs.** All new plans should live here.

## In-Progress / Next Up
- [x] Resource tick refactor follow-ups – unit tests for `updateResourceCategory` and edge cases. (11 Jun 2025)  
- [ ] Action dispatch map – verify hot-reload correctness & add Jest tests.
- [x] Event-driven communication for Log, Encounter, Combat systems (12 Jun 2025).

### Combat UI & Feedback Enhancements (v0.5)
- [x] Damage / shield animation layer – flash bars, floating numbers. (Implemented 14 Jun 2025)
- [x] Enemy-turn telegraph overlay with brief delay. (Implemented 14 Jun 2025)
- [ ] Split-screen battle layout & auto-scrolling log panel.
- [ ] Reduce in-battle resource read-outs to icon + tooltip.
- [ ] Sprite pipeline – generate & add PNGs for each enemy definition.
- [ ] Enemy move list replaces inline battle log; highlight next attack.
- [ ] Charge-delay cycle (player then enemy) with 700 ms telegraph.
- [ ] Battle-log modal accessible via "Open Battle Log" button.

## Backlog
- [x] Event-driven upgrade purchase flow via EventBus (11 Jun 2025).  
- [ ] Break up `CombatSystem` into smaller modules (enemy AI, battle log, helpers).  
- [ ] Cleanup template integrations (Clerk/Stripe) once confirmed unnecessary.  
- [ ] Introduce `cloneState` helper (or Immer) to standardise immutability.  
- [ ] Dynamic registration in `GameSystemManager` (array of systems).  
- [ ] Unit-test baseline across core systems.  
- [ ] Performance: variable tick rates or idle optimisation.

## Completed (recent)
- [x] DRY refactor of `ResourceSystem` – generic cost check/consume and tick helper (11 Jun 2025).  
- [x] Replaced ActionSystem switch with handler map (11 Jun 2025).
- [x] Added unit tests for ResourceSystem generation & cost logic (11 Jun 2025).
- [x] Removed Clerk/Stripe code & deps; deleted unused provider, middleware cleaned, pruned package.json (12 Jun 2025).

- [x] Data-driven catalog for reactor upgrades & generic purchase logic (14 Jun 2025).
