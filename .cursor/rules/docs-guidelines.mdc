# Project Documentation Rules

1. **Single Roadmap** – `.cursor/rules/roadmap.mdc` is the canonical living roadmap / work-log. All task updates go there.
2. **Keep docs current** – Update or delete stale docs alongside code changes.
3. **Template leftovers** – Remove starter template docs unrelated to current code.
4. **Authoritative docs** – Only these markdown files are canonical and must remain accurate:
   • `documentation/architecture_overview.md`
   • `documentation/gameplay_overview.md`
   • `documentation/encounter_system_plan.md`
   • `documentation/combat-system.md`
5. **Review cycle** – At each milestone, audit docs to ensure compliance.
