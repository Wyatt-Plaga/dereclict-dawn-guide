# Derelict Dawn Guide - Gameplay Overview

## The Narrative

In the cold silence of deep space, the automated systems of the colony ship *Dawn* have detected a critical failure. After centuries of dormancy, the ship's AI core - you - has been activated in emergency protocol mode. Your directive is clear but daunting: assess the situation, restore critical systems, and ensure the survival of the remaining colonists who still sleep in cryostasis.

As you regain consciousness, your memory banks are fragmented. The ship's logs are corrupted, and many systems are offline or operating at minimal capacity. What caused this state of emergency? Where is the crew? And most importantly, can the mission still be salvaged?

The once-mighty *Dawn*, designed to carry humanity to a new home amongst the stars, now drifts as a derelict vessel. It falls to you, the ship's awakened intelligence, to guide this wounded behemoth back to operational status and uncover the truth of what transpired during your long sleep.

## Core Gameplay

Derelict Dawn Guide is an incremental/idle game where players take on the role of the ship's AI, working to restore various systems and uncover the mystery of what happened to the colony ship. The gameplay revolves around:

1. **Resource Management**: Generating and allocating different resources across ship systems
2. **System Restoration**: Repairing and upgrading different sections of the ship
3. **Crew Revival**: Awakening colonists from cryostasis to assist in ship operations
4. **Mystery Unfolding**: Discovering fragments of the ship's history through logs and events

As you progress, more of the ship becomes accessible, more colonists can be awakened, and more of the story is revealed.

## Ship Systems

The *Dawn* is divided into several key systems, each with unique functions and upgrade paths:

### Reactor

The heart of the ship, providing the energy necessary for all other systems. Initially operating at minimum capacity, the reactor can be manually stimulated to produce energy and upgraded to increase its efficiency and storage capacity.

**Gameplay Focus**: Energy production and storage optimization

### Processor

The ship's computational core, responsible for data processing and analysis. By generating insight through processing routines, you can unlock upgrades and piece together corrupted ship logs.

**Gameplay Focus**: Information gathering and technology progression

### Crew Quarters

Where the colonists remain in cryostasis. Your initial goal is to stabilize the life support systems and begin the careful process of awakening colonists. Each awakened colonist can be assigned to different tasks around the ship.

**Gameplay Focus**: Crew management and awakening progression

### Manufacturing

The fabrication center of the ship, capable of creating components and materials needed for repairs. By converting scrap into usable parts, you can accelerate the restoration of other ship systems.

**Gameplay Focus**: Production chains and resource conversion

## Resources

### Energy
Generated by the reactor, energy is the most fundamental resource. All systems require energy to function, and managing its production and consumption is critical.

### Insight
Generated through the processor, insight represents your growing understanding of the ship's systems and history. It's used to research new technologies and decrypt corrupted data.

### Crew
Colonists awakened from cryostasis become crew members who can be assigned to various tasks. Each crew member can boost production in different systems.

### Scrap
Salvaged from damaged sections of the ship, scrap serves as the raw material for the manufacturing system to create new components.

## Progression

### Early Game
- Activate basic ship systems
- Generate initial resources manually
- Awaken the first few colonists
- Discover the basic outlines of what happened to the ship

### Mid Game
- Establish automated resource generation
- Optimize resource allocation across systems
- Awaken specialized colonists with unique abilities
- Uncover more detailed logs about the ship's journey

### Late Game
- Manage a growing crew of awakened colonists
- Tackle major ship repairs and system overhauls
- Make critical decisions about the ship's future
- Piece together the complete story of what happened

## Mechanics

### Manual Resource Generation
Click on system interfaces to manually generate resources:
- Reactor: Generate energy pulses
- Processor: Run processing cycles
- Crew Quarters: Assist with awakening procedures
- Manufacturing: Salvage operations

### Upgrades
Each system offers upgrades that improve efficiency, unlock new features, or increase resource caps:
- Production upgrades increase resource generation rates
- Capacity upgrades increase storage limits
- Efficiency upgrades reduce resource consumption
- Special upgrades unlock new gameplay mechanics

### Automation
As you progress, more processes can be automated:
- Worker crew members provide passive resource generation
- Automated systems continue to function when you're focused elsewhere
- Resource overflow systems prevent waste

### Decision Points
At key moments in the narrative, you'll face decisions that impact how the story unfolds and what capabilities become available to you.

## The Unfolding Mystery

As you restore the ship's systems and awaken more colonists, fragments of the ship's logs become accessible. These logs, along with environmental clues throughout the ship, slowly reveal what caused the *Dawn* to become a derelict vessel.

Was it an accident? Sabotage? An encounter with something unknown in the depths of space? As the ship's AI, piecing together this mystery is as important as the physical restoration of the ship itself.

Your decisions will ultimately determine the fate of the *Dawn* and its sleeping passengers. Will you fulfill your original mission, or chart a new course based on what you discover?
