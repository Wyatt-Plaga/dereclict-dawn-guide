# Game Engine Migration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the step-by-step plan for migrating from our current state management approach to the new domain-driven Game Engine architecture. The migration will be gradual to minimize risk, with components being migrated one at a time while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Approach

1. **Parallel Systems**: During migration, we'll run both systems in parallel
2. **Gradual Component Migration**: Update components one at a time
3. **Data Synchronization**: Keep both state systems in sync during transition
4. **Feature Equivalence**: Ensure all features work in both systems before switching

## Migration Steps

### Phase 1: Infrastructure and Preparation ✅

- [x] Implement the core Game Engine with necessary domain services
- [x] Create hooks for accessing game services from the UI layer
- [x] Set up event emitters for resource changes
- [x] Implement state persistence and serialization

### Phase 2: Initial Integration ✅

- [x] Create `GameEngineProvider` for making game state available to components
- [x] Implement `ResourceSynchronizer` for syncing between old and new systems
- [x] Create `GameEngineLayout` as common wrapper for game pages
- [x] Update reactor page to use the new GameEngineLayout

### Phase 3: Page-by-Page Migration (In Progress)

- [x] Reactor Page
  - [x] Wrap with GameEngineLayout
  - [x] Keep using original ResourcePage component initially
  - [x] Gradually enhance with game engine-specific features
  
- [ ] Processor Page
  - [ ] Wrap with GameEngineLayout
  - [ ] Modify to use new hooks alongside existing state
  
- [ ] Crew Quarters Page
  - [ ] Wrap with GameEngineLayout
  - [ ] Migrate to use game engine resources
  
- [ ] Manufacturing Page
  - [ ] Wrap with GameEngineLayout
  - [ ] Migrate to use game engine resources

### Phase 4: Component Migration

- [ ] Resource Management Components
  - [ ] Update to read from both state systems
  - [ ] Modify to write to both systems
  - [ ] Eventually switch to only using game engine
  
- [ ] Upgrade Components
  - [ ] Add game engine upgrade manager integration
  - [ ] Sync between old and new upgrade systems
  
- [ ] Log Components
  - [ ] Route all logs through game engine logging system
  - [ ] Migrate UI to use new log format and filtering

### Phase 5: Complete Transition

- [ ] Remove old state management code
- [ ] Clean up synchronization components
- [ ] Optimize data flows for the new architecture
- [ ] Add final polish and testing

## Testing Strategy

- Implement parallel testing in development environment
- Create test scenarios that verify both systems respond identically
- Add automated tests for critical game functions
- Perform user testing with both systems running in parallel

## Rollback Plan

1. Create backup of codebase before major migration points
2. Maintain legacy systems until confident in new architecture
3. Keep feature flags to disable new code if issues arise
4. Document dependencies between components for easier rollback
