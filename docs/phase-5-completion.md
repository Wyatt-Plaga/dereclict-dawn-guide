# Phase 5 Completion Report - Modular Action Handling

## Summary
Phase 5 has been successfully completed. The centralized ActionSystem has been eliminated and replaced with a fully event-driven architecture where each system handles its own actions.

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ 5.1 - Canonical Action Event Map
Created `app/game/actions/index.ts` with typed action definitions:
- `action:resource_click`
- `action:purchase_upgrade`
- `action:mark_log_read`
- `action:mark_all_logs`
- `action:story_choice`
- `action:combat_move`
- `action:retreat`
- `action:start_encounter`
- `action:toggle_automation`
- `action:adjust_automation`
- `action:initiate_jump`

### ✅ 5.2 - EventBus Extended for Actions
The EventBus already supported ActionMap through the unified GameEventMap type.

### ✅ 5.3 - System-Local Action Handlers
Each system now subscribes to its own actions:
- **ResourceSystem**: `action:resource_click`, `action:adjust_automation`
- **UpgradeSystem**: `action:purchase_upgrade`
- **LogSystem**: `action:mark_log_read`, `action:mark_all_logs`
- **CombatSystem**: `action:combat_move`, `action:retreat`
- **EncounterSystem**: `action:story_choice`, `action:initiate_jump`

### ✅ 5.4 - UI Dispatch Rewrite
The `useGame` hook now provides a typed `dispatchAction` function that publishes directly to the EventBus.

### ✅ 5.5 - ActionSystem Removed
- `ActionSystem.ts` has been deleted
- `GameSystemManager` no longer has an `action` field
- No references to `processAction` remain
- No `DISPATCH_ACTION` events in the codebase

### ✅ 5.6 - Tests Added
Created comprehensive tests in `__tests__/game/actions/actions.test.ts` to verify:
- All action types are defined
- Systems are properly initialized
- Actions can be dispatched without errors

## Outstanding Items

### Actions Without Handlers
Two actions are defined but not yet implemented:
- `action:start_encounter` - May be redundant with encounter generation
- `action:toggle_automation` - May be redundant with `adjust_automation`

These could be removed from ActionMap if not needed, or implemented if there's a use case.

## Migration Notes

### Import Path Updates
During Phase 5, we also fixed import paths throughout the codebase:
- Changed `from 'core/...'` to `from '@/core/...'` for proper module resolution
- This ensures tests and builds work correctly

## Exit Criteria Met

✅ Every action event in ActionMap has been considered
✅ No direct calls from one system into another
✅ CI test suite covers action dispatching
✅ No ActionSystem.ts file exists
✅ Zero DISPATCH_ACTION strings in codebase
✅ Zero imports from removed ActionSystem

## Next Steps

With Phase 5 complete, the codebase now has:
- Clean separation of concerns
- Event-driven architecture
- Type-safe action handling
- No god objects or central dispatchers

Ready to proceed to Phase 6 (Data-Driven Upgrades & Content) or any other refactoring tasks.
