# Game Engine Migration Plan

## Completed Tasks
- ✅ Updated the Game class to pass its event emitter to the ResourceManager
- ✅ Wrapped all pages (Reactor, Processor, Crew quarters, Manufacturing, Logs) in the GameEngineLayout
- ✅ Created adapter hooks:
  - ✅ useResourcesAdapter - connects old resources with game engine resources
  - ✅ useUpgradesAdapter - connects old upgrades with game engine upgrades
  - ✅ useLogsAdapter - connects old logs with game engine logs
  - ✅ useResourcePageAdapter - connects ResourcePage components with the new adapters
  - ✅ useLogsPageAdapter - specialized adapter for the Logs page
- ✅ Updated all pages to use the new adapters

## Remaining Tasks

### Phase 1: Stabilize and Test
1. Thoroughly test all pages to ensure they're working correctly with the new adapters
2. Fix any issues that arise during testing
3. Add better error handling to the adapters
4. Establish a system for tracking which logs and upgrades have been unlocked in the game engine

### Phase 2: Refine Resource Management
1. Implement proper resource rate handling
   - Ensure automatic resource generation works correctly
   - Connect resource generation to the game engine's time system
2. Implement resource consumption
   - Create a system for resources to be consumed by game processes
3. Add visual indicators for resource changes

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features
1. Create a new GameStatsPage component that shows:
   - Resource statistics and production rates
   - Unlocked upgrades
   - Game progress
2. Implement game events that trigger based on resource levels or milestones
3. Add sound effects for important game events
4. Create a notification system for important game events

### Phase 4: Remove Old Code
1. Identify all components and utilities that only use the old system
2. Create replacements for these components using the new game engine
3. Remove dependencies on the old state management system
4. Clean up unused files and code

### Phase 5: Optimize and Launch
1. Optimize performance, especially around resource calculations
2. Perform final testing on all game systems
3. Update documentation to reflect the new architecture
4. Launch the new version with the fully migrated game engine

## Architecture Notes

### Adapter Pattern
The adapters we've created follow the Adapter design pattern, allowing the old UI components to work with the new game engine. This approach has several benefits:

- Enables gradual migration without breaking existing functionality
- Allows us to test the new system alongside the old one
- Provides a clear separation between UI and game logic

### Event-Driven Architecture
The new game engine uses an event-driven architecture where:

- Game components emit events when state changes
- Other components can listen for these events and react accordingly
- This allows for loose coupling between components

### Future Improvements
After completing the migration, we can consider:

- Adding more sophisticated game mechanics
- Implementing save/load functionality
- Creating a modding system for extending the game
- Adding multiplayer features

## Timeline Estimate
- Phase 1: 1-2 days
- Phase 2: 2-3 days
- Phase 3: 3-4 days
- Phase 4: 1-2 days
- Phase 5: 1-2 days

Total: 8-13 days to complete the migration
